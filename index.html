            For some children, learning mathematics is a frightening specter. How difficult, how easy it is. Often because they feel hard, the children become lazy to learn math and even run.
Parents and educators have tried various ways to teach mathematics to children and their learners. And of the many methods, most approaches provide the most surprising result was the approach taken by Glenn Doman method, namely Dot Method. And it turns out, this method can be taught from infancy and has yielded amazing results!
During these lessons we learn and teach math in a very long and difficult. Counting with fingers, counting by a stick and lighters, then memorize the sum up to the division, memorizing formulas, and so on.
In fact, according to Glenn Doman, children are born with the ability to see the quantity of objects they see. You remember the movie Rain Man? In the film, one could mention the exact number of toothpicks just by looking without counting them. And apparently, all children, even those that have brain defects were able to do so and will lose that ability if we as parents do not help develop it properly. Therefore, the first three years of his life, a child's brain develops very rapidly.
Dot Method which was introduced by Glenn Doman uses Dot Card, ie, the cards contain small circles drawn in red at random.
How to stage this method works to help parents teach mathematics in infants and balitanya?
Previously, you must understand the concepts and basic rules in this method:
1. Start as early as possible2. Be happy all the time3. Respect your child4. Teach only when you and your baby feel happy and excited5. Stop before your child wants to quit6. Return quickly7. Introducing the new object as often as possible8. Perform consistently9. Prepare materials properly and continuously10. Stop if you and your child does not have a fun time to learn
Once you understand this concept, then now is the time you make props that you need to learn with your baby:
1. Dot cards: create card of manila paper or white cardboard with size 28 × 28 cm as many as 100 cards. Draw or attach each card with a circle or a red dot lights up with a diameter of 2 cm, with serial number 1 to 100. This circle must be your bunk at random, and do not forget to include the numbers on the page opposite.
2. Card Numer: draw a card from manila paper or cardboard to the size of 14 × 14 cm as many as 100 cards. Write or paste the bold figures of approximately 12-13 cm tall with bright red color, sequence of numbers 1 through 100.
Step-by-step instruction:

    * First step: the introduction of number. Show the card with a dot, and say, "this one". Do it very quickly (in seconds) and the child should focus on the card that you show. Perform this step 3 times a day, enough only 5 cards per day.
    * Step two: the introduction of the equation number. Take 3 pieces of card, eg card 3, 2, and 5. Say, "two plus three equal five." Perform this step 3 times a day and enough 3 equation every day. In this step, at every interval of 2 weeks, after the accretion equations, equations also do subtraction, multiplication, and division. And remember, do not do repeat on different days and do not do the test.
    * Third step: solve the problem. Take 4 cards, for example, card 4, 8, 12, and 20. Say, "four plus eight equals two dozen or twenty?". Let your child think and show the answer. If your child has not been able to appoint or mention the answer, then consider the focus of his eyes. Do not force it if he is not willing or not able to answer accurately. Stay hug and give kisses full of love although the answer is wrong.
    * The fourth step: the introduction of numbers. Well, at this step, take your card numer card sized 14 × 14 cm. Do as the first step by showing the card labeled with the number 1, and say, "this one". Perform this step is the same as the previous steps until the cards run out.
You may be wondering, how far this method successfully applied to your child at home?
If I may argue, in fact this method is just one of many alternative methods of teaching methods available. The percentage of success just as percentage of success of other methods. It all comes back and depend on you as a parent and child on your own.
Many people use this method and success. But not a few who passed without stunning results. Again, this method is the same as a system: you and your child is that each partner determines its success.
GOOD LUCK !!!

            Why teaching math in early age? From Doman’s study, math is a language. It is a language that most people have an inherent fear of it. Of course, I am one of it. Until today, I’m still remembering the math nightmare in my childhood that fear of math class, math teacher, math test….everything aobut math. So I am thinking….if Doman’s “early teaching” is workable, why not give it a try? Teaching my baby the most difficult language-math becasue baby doesn’t know what is easy and what is difficult. To them, everything is new and fun.
